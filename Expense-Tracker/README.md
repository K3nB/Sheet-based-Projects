## 📊 Google Sheets Structure

Create a Google Sheet with **two tabs**:

### 1. `DROPDOWNS`

Used to populate the Member and Category dropdowns in the UI.

| Column | Header    | Description           |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------|
| A      | EMPLOYEE  | Family member names   |
| B      | CATEGORY  | Expense categories    |

Example:

| EMPLOYEE | CATEGORY               |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Father  | Housing & Utilities     |
| Mother  | Groceries & Household   |
| You     | Transportation          |
| Sibling | Education               |

> The script reads **A2:A** for members and **B2:B** for categories (ignores blanks and trims spaces).

---

### 2. `DATA`

All submitted expenses are stored here.

| Column | Header           | Description                          |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| A      | Date Entered     | Timestamp when form was submitted    |
| B      | Employee         | Member name (from dropdown)          |
| C      | Transaction Date | Actual expense date                  |
| D      | Category         | Expense category                     |
| E      | Amount           | Amount spent                         |
| F      | Description      | Optional notes                       |

> **Do not** change the column positions. You can rename headers if you like, but keep the order A–F as above.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### UI (`Index.html`)

- Dark-themed Bootstrap form with:
  - **Member dropdown** (`#employeeSelect`)
  - Dynamic **transaction rows** (`date`, `category`, `amount`, `description`)
  - **Add row** and **Delete row** controls
  - **Submit Expenses** button

- Below the form:
  - **Transaction history section** that appears when a member is selected
  - Shows:
    - Date Entered
    - Transaction Date
    - Category
    - Amount
    - Description
  - Sorted by **latest transaction date**
  - Displays:
    - `Total Transactions`
    - `Total Amount (₹)`

- Uses `google.script.run` to talk to Apps Script backend:
  - `getDropdownData()` – loads members & categories
  - `submitExpenses(data)` – writes rows to `DATA`
  - `getEmployeeTransactions(name)` – loads history for a member

---

### Backend (`Code.gs`)

Key parts:

#### Config

```js
const SS = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
const SH_DROPDOWNS = 'DROPDOWNS';
const SH_DATA = 'DATA';
````

#### Web App Entry

```js
function doGet() {
  return HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('Index')
    .setTitle('Expense Entry Form')
    .setXFrameOptionsMode(HtmlService.XFrameOptionsMode.ALLOWALL);
}


#### Load Dropdown Data

```js
function getDropdownData() {
  // Reads DROPDOWNS!A2:A for members and B2:B for categories
  // Trims spaces and ignores empty cells
  ...
}
```

#### Submit Expenses

```js
function submitExpenses(data) {
  // Cleans member name
  // Loops over transactions, builds rows [DateEntered, Member, TxnDate, Category, Amount, Description]
  // Appends them to DATA sheet
  // Returns { success: true/false, message: '...' }
}
```

#### Get Member History

```js
function getEmployeeTransactions(employeeName) {
  // Reads DATA!A2:F
  // Normalizes name with trim + lowercase
  // Filters by member and returns an array of objects:
  // { dateEntered, employee, transactionDate, category, amount, description }
}
```

The front-end then renders this array as the history table and calculates totals.
